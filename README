**** TO BE CHECKED ****
To properly integrate the mcli plugin into your VDR please apply these two
patches:

vdr-1.6.0-altmenuaction.patch (allows CAM messages to be displayed)
vdr-1.6.0-intcamdevices.patch (enables selection of encrypted channels
                               without local CI stack).
